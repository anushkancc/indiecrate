      <p>
        IndieCrate was born from a simple idea - to give artisans the platform
        they deserve. Every handcrafted piece carries history, skill, and emotion.
        By connecting local creators directly to people who value authentic
        craftsmanship, we keep culture alive and thriving.
      </p>
      <p>
        We work closely with communities to ensure fair trade, empower artists,
        and encourage sustainable practices. Your purchase isn’t just a product -
        it’s a part of someone’s dream.
